What is this?
-------------

dailygraphics is a framework for creating and deploying responsive graphics suitable for publishing inside a CMS with [pym.js](https://github.com/nprapps/pym.js).

#### How This Works

In addition to big, long-term projects, the NPR Visuals team also produces short-turnaround charts and tables for daily stories. Our dailygraphics rig offers a workflow and some automated machinery for creating, deploying and embedding these mini-projects, including:

* Version control (with GitHub)
* One command to deploy to Amazon S3
* A mini-CMS for each project (with Google Spreadsheets)
* Management of binary assets (like photos or audio files) outside of GitHub

Assumptions
-----------

The following things are assumed to be true in this documentation.

* You are running OSX.
* You are using Python 2.7. (Probably the version that came with OSX.)
* You have [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) installed and working.
* You have your Amazon Web Services credentials stored as environment variables locally.

For more details on the technology stack used with this project, see our [development environment blog post](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/06/06/how-to-setup-a-developers-environment.html).

What's In Here?
---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``etc`` -- Miscellanous Python libraries.
* ``fabfile`` -- [Fabric](http://docs.fabfile.org/en/latest/) commands for automating setup and deployment.
* ``graphic_templates`` -- Folder templates for different graphic types.
* ``templates`` -- HTML ([Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)) templates, to be compiled locally.
* ``app.py`` -- A [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app for rendering the project locally.
* ``app_config.py`` -- Global project configuration for scripts, deployment, etc.
* ``graphic.py`` -- Flask views for rendering graphics.
* ``graphic_templates.py`` -- Flask views for rendering graphics templates.
* ``oauth.py`` -- Flask views for configuring OAuth (for Google Spreadsheets).
* ``package.json`` -- Node requirements.
* ``render_utils.py`` -- Code supporting template rendering.
* ``requirements.txt`` -- Python requirements.

Bootstrap The Project
---------------------

Node.js is required for the static asset pipeline. If you don't already have it, get it like this (requires [brew](http://brew.sh/)):

```
brew install node
```

Then set up the project like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics.git
cd dailygraphics
mkvirtualenv dailygraphics
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

You'll now need to create a folder to hold the graphics created and deployed by this rig. This is configured in `app_config.GRAPHICS_PATH` and defaults to `../graphics`.

**NPR users:** Graphics are stored in a separate, private repository, and `app_config.GRAPHICS_PATH` points to that folder. You will need to separately `git clone` that repository.

**All other users:** You can choose to keep your work in a separate repository, as we do, or you can change the `app_config.GRAPHICS_PATH` to point to a folder inside of `dailygraphics`.

Using A Stable Version
----------------------

The master branch of project is in active development by NPR at all times. If you would like to use a [more] stable version, we suggest checking out a tagged version (``0.1``, etc.). We will periodically tag releases, which will be synchronized to the ``CHANGELOG`` so you will know exactly what improvements you will get if you migrate to a new tagged version.

To see available tagged versions, run:

```
git tag -l
```

To use a tagged version run, for example:

```
git checkout 0.1.0
```

To upgrade to a newer tagged version just check it out:

```
git checkout 0.2.0
```

When upgrading from one tagged version to another, please be sure to update your Python requirements:

```
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
```

Configuration
-------------

The dailygraphics project configuration defaults are specific to NPR. If you want to use it in your newsroom you should fork this repository and update ``app_config.py`` with your own configuration.

At a minimum you will want to change ``REPOSITORY_URL``, ``PRODUCTION_S3_BUCKETS``, ``STAGING_S3_BUCKETS`` and ``ASSETS_S3_BUCKET``. (``ASSETS_S3_BUCKET`` *must* be different from the other buckets.)

**Google OAuth**

The default configuration assumes that you want to use NPR's copytext rig to [pull content from a Google Spreadsheet](#connecting-to-a-google-spreadsheet). If you do not want to use Google Spreadsheets at all, delete all instances of ```graphic_config.py``` from the template folders inside ```graphic_templates```. You can skip the OAuth steps below.

As of April 2015, we've changed our approach to authenticating with Google to sync Google Spreadsheet data. Now, dailygraphics relies on OAuth authentication. This approach is more secure (username and password are no longer stored in environment variables) and works for accounts with two-factor authentication enabled.

Following the steps in [this blog post](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/03/02/app-template-oauth.html), you will need to:
- Set up a Google API application for your organization
- Save the client environment variables in your ```.bash_profile```
- Authenticate with Google.

You should only need to do this once.

**NPR users:** The environment variables you need have already been generated, so you can skip the first step. Contact Alyson or Juan for more information.


Run The Project
---------------

A Flask app is used to run the project locally. It will automatically recompile templates on-demand.

```
workon dailygraphics
fab app
```

Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) for a list of graphics in the repo. Click on the graphic you are working on to view it. Alternately, visit ```http://localhost:8000/graphics/$SLUG``` in your browser to view the specific graphic you are working on.

#### Terminal shortcut

Do you use [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com) as your terminal app? Here's [a sample AppleScript](https://gist.github.com/jjelosua/53b416bd6655605846264eb9378e9c0e) to automatically launch a three-paned terminal window (one for the dailygraphics machine, one for the local webserver, and another for the separate graphics repo).

You can save this locally, customize it to match your own configuration and add an alias for it to your `.bash_profile`.

```
alias dailygraphics="osascript ~/PATH-TO-FILE/iterm_dailygraphics.scpt"
```

#### Troubleshooting

Do you get an error that looks like this when you run the webserver?

```
Fatal error: local() encountered an error (return code 1) while executing 'gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 --debug --reload app:wsgi_app'

Aborting.
```

It's possible that the webserver is already running silently in the background. [Here's how to fix it.](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/issues/74)


Add A New Graphic
-----------------

dailygraphics includes starter code for a few different types of graphics (and we're slowly adding more as we go). Running any of these commands will create the folder ```$SLUG``` within your ```app_config.GRAPHICS_PATH``` folder. Within the new folder will be a ```child_template.html``` file and some boilerplate javascript files. ```child_template.html``` is a Jinja template that will be rendered with a context containing the contents of ```app_config.py```, ```graphic_config.py``` and the ```COPY``` document for that graphic. It also will clone a new Google Spreadsheet for you to use for text and data.

Build out your graphic in ```child_template.html```, and put your javascript in ```js/graphic.js```.

| ![Animated photo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/master/graphic_templates/_thumbs/animated-photo.gif) | Animated photo (GIF alternative) | ```fab add_animated_photo:$SLUG``` |

**Note**: `$SLUG` should be URL-safe, e.g., lowercase and with dashes instead of spaces and no special characters.

Here are some examples:

* Good: my-project-name<br>Bad: My-Project-NAME
* Good: my-project-name<br>Bad: my project name
* Good: my-wonderful-project<br>Bad: my wonderful project!

Dailygraphics by default will append the current date to your slug name, YYYMMDD-style -- for example: ```my-project-name-20170415```. This is for clarity and to help prevent ovewriting existing projects. You can also manually specify a date. If the date you specify is not a valid date, dailygraphics will use the current date instead.

When you create a new project, dailygraphics will check against your local projects and the projects published to production to make sure that the ```$SLUG``` (plus date) you've chosen does not already exist.

Clone An Old Graphic
-----------------
If you want to use an old graphic as a starting point for a new graphic -- with a new instance of the graphic's spreadsheet so you don't overwrite the old content -- use this command:

```
fab clone_graphic:$OLD_SLUG,$NEW_SLUG
```

It will search for a given slug in our graphics and graphics-archive repositories and clone it, creating a new ready-to-work-on graphic.

The first (required) parameter -- ```$OLD_SLUG``` -- is the graphic slug you are trying to clone. The second parameter -- ```$NEW_SLUG``` -- is optional. If specified, it will be used to generate the new graphic slug. Otherwise, if no ```$NEW_SLUG``` is specified, the new graphic slug will be derived from the ```$OLD_SLUG```, replacing the date at the end of the slug with the current date (or, if ```$OLD_SLUG``` did not include a date, appending the current date at the end).

Examples (if today was ```20160705```):

```
fab clone_graphic:my-project-name-20150415,my-new-project-20160706
// Results in my-new-project-20160706
```

```
fab clone_graphic:my-project-name
// Results in my-project-name-20160705
```

```
fab clone_graphic:my-project-name-20150415
// Results in my-project-name-20160705
```

```
fab clone_graphic:my-wrong-project-name-20150415
// Results in an error if not found in graphics or graphics-archive repos
```

Deploy To S3
------------

To deploy a specific graphic:

```
fab staging deploy:$SLUG
```
```
fab production deploy:$SLUG
```

You can deploy multiple graphics with a single command by passing the slugs as a comma-separated list (no spaces). To deploy multiple graphics at once:

```
fab staging deploy:$SLUG1,$SLUG2
```
```
fab production deploy:$SLUG1,$SLUG2
```

#### Deploy graphics that exist in an arbitrary location

At NPR, we occasionally need to redeploy old graphics in our `graphics-archive` repo. The deployment command supports passing either a relative path to the graphic from dailygraphics or by passing an absolute path. This functionality can be used to render and deploy graphics that are outside the `GRAPHICS_PATH` location in `app_config.py` as long as the graphic has the templates and files required for graphics created by `dailygraphics`.

```
fab staging deploy:"path"
```
```
fab production deploy:"path"
```

_Wrapping the path in quotes is needed if the path contains spaces._

To deploy a specific archived graphic:

```
fab staging deploy:"../graphics-archive/2016/01/100-words-20160122"
```
```
fab staging deploy:"/home/user/Projects/graphics-archive/2016/01/100-words-20160122"
```

Dependent fabric commands are also available, including `render` and `update_copy`. For example:

```
fab staging render:"../graphics-archive/2016/01/100-words-20160122"
```
```
fab staging update_copy:"../graphics-archive/2016/01/100-words-20160122"
```

You can deploy multiple graphics with a single command by passing the slugs as a comma-separated list (no spaces). To deploy multiple graphics at once:

```
fab staging deploy:path1,path2
```

_Warning: There is no preview available for these changes and deployments. If you need to make a significant change or actively work on a graphic outside of the primary graphics folder, it may be better to clone the graphic and start fresh._

Test Capabilities
-----------------

#### Installation

At NPR, we recently had to update all of our past graphics to faciltate the site's switch to `https`. We have introduced test capabilities to trim down the review process for this project -- but this functionality can and probably should be a part of our regular deployment.

Our basic test functionality uses [selenium for python](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) to launch and validate the deployment url for a graphic or multiple graphics. The process makes a screenshot of the Chrome page and writes a log of the warnings, errors and ```console.log()``` statements that we may find.

* Selenium is included in our `requirements.txt`.

* To use [chrome webdriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads), download and unzip the corresponding version for your platform and put it somewhere on the `$PATH` so that selenium can find it. (You could include the path to the binary on the webdriver call but let's stick to only one approach.)

As an alternative to `chrome-webdriver`, you can use [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/). However, we have found that the browser logging granularity is a bit worse. To install phantomjs:

```
$ brew install phantomjs
```

There are other drivers ([see here](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)) that you could use, and it should be quite straightforward to modify the code to do that. Since this is not intended as a cross-browser test, sticking to one browser serves our needs.

#### Test Deployment

*Important:* _The testing functionality assumes that the graphic has already been deployed and its corresponding url is accessible._

Once you have installed the needed binaries and libraries we are ready to start testing.

The main entry point is a fabric task:

```
fab $ENV test:path
```

Where $ENV should be replaced by the desired environment `staging` or `production`

You could do them on more than one graphic by separating paths with commas

```
fab $ENV test:path1,path2
```

If you need/want to run the test on more than a couple of graphics we have you covered, you can use the `bulk_test` fabric task

```
fab $ENV test.bulk_test:$CSVPATH
```

`$CSVPATH` is an absolute or relative path to the location of a csv file that will have either one path to a graphic per line or one url per line.

If a path is given on each line the task will use the provided `$ENV` to calculate the deployed url and test it.

If a url is given on each line you do not need to specify a `$ENV` since the url is already provided.

As a result the test rig will create a screenshot and a logfile for each graphic inside `test` folder. If `bulk_test` is used it will create a subfolder with the timestamp and inside it it will create a logfile for all the process and a screenshot for each graphic.

If there's an existing graphic report (screenshot + log) for a given graphic and environment and you run the test for that same configuration again the report will be overwritten, let's save some space right?

#### Fine-Tuning Test Deployment

All the fabric tasks mentioned above have some behavior that can be customized:

* `use`: Which webdriver to use on the tests, defaults to `Chrome`
* `screenshot`: Whether to make a screenshot or not of the tested page, defaults to `True`
* `pymParent`: Whether we want to reinforce a communication protocol on Pym
 to ensure that the page has loaded correctly, defaults to `False`

Let's say we have installed phantomjs and want to test using that webdriver, we could run:

```
$ fab $ENV test:path,use='phantom'
```

Let's say we do not want a screenshot to be taken for one of our bulk tests:

```
$ fab $ENV test.bulk_test:$CSVPATH,screenshot=False
```

Let's say we are using the rendered index page for our graphic and want to enforce `Pym.js` communication prior to checking our page.

```
$ fab $ENV test:path,pymParent=True
```

Embedding
---------

Deploy the project to production. Visit ```http://apps.npr.org/dailygraphics/graphics/$SLUG```, and on that page should be an ```iframe``` with your graphic inside of it, and an embed code below the graphic. Paste the embed code into your page. (Some CMSes treat code snippets like this as a separate "HTML asset.")


Connecting To A Google Spreadsheet
----------------------------------

This section describes usage of NPR's copytext rig for syncing text from a Google Spreadsheet.

When you create a new graphic, dailygraphics will by default clone our [dailygraphics copy spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ciRc--h8HuBpQzMebVygC4x_y9dvKxp6OA45ccRrIX4/edit#gid=0). To use a different spreadsheet (either in your graphics templates or in a particular project), update the ```graphic_config.py``` file in your graphic's folder with the ID of your spreadsheet:

```
COPY_GOOGLE_DOC_KEY = '0AlXMOHKxzQVRdHZuX1UycXplRlBfLVB0UVNldHJYZmc'
```

Run this command to pull down the latest copy of the spreadsheet:

```
fab update_copy:$SLUG
```

Alternately, while you are developing your graphic locally, you can append ```?refresh=1``` to your graphic's localhost URL to refresh the spreadsheet every time you refresh the page. (It can be a little slow, though, so it might be most efficient to do this only when youâ€™re actively working on the spreadsheet.)

To pull down **all** spreadsheets in the dailygraphics repository, run:

```
fab update_copy
```

The deploy process will always pull down the latest spreadsheet and render the contents to your page.

Note: Your published graphic **will not** automatically update every time your spreadsheet updates. It will only update when you deploy (or redeploy) it. For projects that seldom change, this is usually fine. Consider another solution if you need dynamic updates.

If you do **not** want want to use the copytext spreadsheet for a given project, you can either set ``COPY_GOOGLE_DOC_KEY`` to ``None`` or delete the ``graphic_config.py`` file entirely.

Open Linked Google Spreadsheet
------------------------------
Want to edit/view a graphic's linked google spreadsheet, we got you covered.

We have created a simple Fabric task ```open_spreadsheet``` that requires a graphic slug. It will try to find and open the graphic's linked google spreadsheet on your default browser. In order to find the graphic it will first try on the graphics path defined in ```app_config.GRAPHICS_PATH``` and then on the graphics-archive path defined in ```app_config.ARCHIVE_GRAPHICS_PATH```

```
fab open_spreadsheet:$SLUG
```

Using Jinja Filter Functions
----------------------------

A [library of Jinja filter functions](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/blob/master/graphic_templates/_base/base_filters.py) for common tasks (ordinal, AP date format, etc.) is included with each graphic.

If your graphic requires complex number formatting or other nuanced presentation, you may need to write a custom filter function. This is supported through each project's ``graphic_config.py`` file. To add a custom filter function, simply define it and add it to the list called ``JINJA_FILTER_FUNCTIONS``, like so:

```python
def percent(value):
    return unicode(float(value * 100)) + '%'

    JINJA_FILTER_FUNCTIONS = base_filters.FILTERS + [percent]
```

Then you will be able to use it in your template like this:

```html
<td>{{ row.value|percent }}</td>
```

See the ``table`` graphic template for a more complete example.


Storing Media Assets
--------------------

(Note: this section describes usage of NPR's assets rig. This is optional and you don't need to use it in order to use dailygraphics.)

Large media assets (images, videos, audio) are synced with an Amazon S3 bucket configured in ```app_config.ASSETS_S3_BUCKET``` in a folder with the name of the project. This allows everyone who works on the project to access these assets without storing them in the graphics repository, giving us faster clone times and the ability to open source our work.

When you use one of the supported fab commands to create a new graphic (e.g., ```fab add_graphic:$SLUG```), your graphic folder will include an ```assets``` folder. Files stored here will not go up to GitHub, but will sync with S3.

Syncing these assets requires running a couple different commands at the right times. When you create new assets or make changes to current assets that need to get uploaded to the server, run ```fab assets.sync:$SLUG```. This will do a few things:

* If there is an asset on S3 that does not exist on your local filesystem it will be downloaded.
* If there is an asset on that exists on your local filesystem but not on S3, you will be prompted to either upload (type "u") OR delete (type "d") your local copy.
* You can also upload all local files (type "la") or delete all local files (type "da"). Type "c" to cancel if you aren't sure what to do.
* If both you and the server have an asset and they are the same, it will be skipped.
* If both you and the server have an asset and they are different, you will be prompted to take either the remote version (type "r") or the local version (type "l").
* You can also take all remote versions (type "ra") or all local versions (type "la"). Type "c" to cancel if you aren't sure what to do.

Unfortunately, there is no automatic way to know when a file has been intentionally deleted from the server or your local directory. When you want to simultaneously remove a file from the server and your local environment (i.e. it is not needed in the project any longer), run ```fab assets.rm:"$SLUG/assets/file_name_here.jpg"```

There's a `private` subfolder inside `assets`. Files inside that `private` folder will be synced to the Amazon S3 bucket configured in ```app_config.ASSETS_S3_BUCKET``` but will not be pushed to the final graphic location and thus will not be publicly accesible. You can use the `assets/private` folder to share assets with your team but not expose them publicly.

Creating Locator Maps
---------------------

The new locator map template is designed to simplify creating basic locator maps with D3, TopoJSON and [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) data. It will not create production-ready maps, but it will quickly generate a code-based starting point for a map project.

To generate the necessary TopoJSON file, you will need to install the [mapturner](https://github.com/nprapps/mapturner) library. Mapturner also requires ogr2ogr/GDAL and topojson. **[See the mapturner docs](https://github.com/nprapps/mapturner)** for set-up information.

_(Note: The code in our example is tailored for a map centered on Nepal. You'll want to edit the configuration, JavaScript and LESS accordingly.)_

To get started, create a new graphic using that template:

```
fab add_map:$slug
```

Inside the project folder, edit the configuration file ```geodata.yaml``` to specify the particular layers and data columns you want. Options included:

* ```bbox```: The bounding box for your map. To get coordinates (```x1 y1 x2 y2```, space-delimited) appropriate to your project, go to a site like [Bounding Box](http://boundingbox.klokantech.com), draw a box around the area you want (with a good amount of margin), and copy the coordinates of that box. (If you're using Bounding Box, choose the "CSV" coordinate output and replace the commas with spaces.)
* Default layers: ```countries```, ```cities``` (for the primary/featured country), ```neighbors``` (for neighboring countries), ```lakes``` and ```rivers```. The default layers point to Natural Earth shapefiles. mapturner also supports geoJSON and CSVs with latitude and longitude columns.
* For each shapefile layer, you can specify options to pass to the TopoJSON converter, including:
  * ```id-property```: a column value you want to use as an identifier in the exported TopoJSON file
  * ```properties```: columns you want TopoJSON to preserve in the exported file (by default, it strips out most non-geo data)
  * ```where```: a query to pass in to filter the data returned (for example: ```where: adm0name != 'Nepal' AND scalerank <= 2```)

([See the mapturner docs](https://github.com/nprapps/mapturner) for more details.)

In your terminal, in the ```dailygraphics``` virtualenv, navigate to your project folder. Run mapturner to process your map's geodata:

```
mapturner geodata.yaml data/geodata.json
```

In your project's ```js/graphic.js```, change the ```primaryCountry``` variable in the `renderLocatorMap` config options from Nepal to the name of your featured country. To fine-tune the positioning of your map, adjust the `defaultScale` and aspect ratio variables, or specify an offset position in pixels by passing a `pixelOffset` config option as `[ X_OFFSET, Y_OFFSET]`.

Creating Animated Photos
------------------------

The animated photo template uses the [canvid](https://github.com/gka/canvid) JavaScript library as an alternative to GIFs. With this solution, you composite a "filmstrip" of all the frames in your animation, and canvid plays them back in sequence on a canvas element. [See an example on NPR.org.](http://www.npr.org/2015/11/05/453239276/in-the-amazons-fire-season-you-either-burn-or-you-starve#res454735072)

Benefits of this approach:

* You can use JPGs rather than GIFs, allowing you to have better image quality _and_ smaller file sizes.
* You can sub out different-sized images depending on the browser dimensions.
* You can control playback -- play, pause, reverse, etc.
* It will autoplay on iOS (unlike a video).

Since it's code-based, it's not quite as portable as a GIF. (So our script that creates the filmstrips also [generates a GIF version](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/blob/master/graphic_templates/animated_photo/process.sh#L12-L15) for social media.) But in the context of a web page that you otherwise control, the benefits are pretty great. (A similar but more code-intensive approach: [Filmstrip animations with CSS/JS](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/01/08/animation-with-filmstrips.html).)

This template relies on [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/montage.php)'s montage function to create the filmstrip image and animated GIF. If you don't have it, install it with:

```
brew install imagemagick
```

To create a new animated photo, run:

```
fab add_animated_photo:$slug
```

Add the frames for your animation to `img/frames/` (in your project folder). (An image sequence from NASA is in there as an example. You can delete those.) All frames must be the same size.

Then, on the command line, navigate to your project folder and run the image processing script to create filmstrips at three different sizes.

```
bash process.sh
```

In `js/graphic.js`, you will need to edit two lines of code.

First, update the number of frames, columns and speed of your animation.

```
videos: {
    // frames = # of stills
    // cols = # of stills in a row in the filmstrip. in this case,
    //        same as frames.
    // fps = frames per second (animation speed). integers only
    photo: { src: sprite, frames: 8, cols: 8, fps: 2 }
```

Second, adjust the image aspect ratio (so it scales correctly in the browser). If you do not know the exact aspect ratio (like 16:9, etc.), enter the height and width (in that order) of one of your frames.

```
// multiply by height, width of original image
height: Math.floor(containerWidth * 1614/1500),
```

Creating An ai2html Graphic
---------------------------

The ai2html template uses an open-source script called [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) to convert Illustrator graphics to HTML and CSS and display them in our responsive dailygraphics template.

To use this template, you'll need to install ai2html as an Illustrator
script. Copy [the latest version of the script here](etc/ai2html.jsx)
into the Illustrator folder where scripts are located.
For example, on Mac OS X running Adobe Illustrator CC 2015, the path would be:
`/Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2015/Presets.localized/en_US/Scripts/ai2html.jsx`

**You only need to install the script once on your machine.** To check whether you
have it installed, open Adobe Illustrator and look for the "ai2html"
command in File >> Scripts.

To create a new ai2html graphic, run:

```
fab add_ai2html_graphic:$slug
```

The basic project includes an Illustrator file in `assets`, which you'll
use to create your graphic. The three artboards in the file are the
three breakpoints for your graphic, allowing you to create custom
versions for mobile, tablet and desktop-sized screens. (If you want to
change the width of these artboards, you'll need to adjust the media
queries in `css/graphic.less`.)

You can only use fonts that are supported on our website, so make sure
you are using the correct typeface and weight. [Here's a list of
supported fonts](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/blob/ai2html/etc/ai2html.jsx#L593-L605).
(For users outside of NPR, refer to the [ai2html docs](http://ai2html.org/#using-fonts-other-than-arial-and-georgia) to learn how to customize your fonts.)

Create your graphic within Illustrator, referring to the [ai2html
documentation](http://ai2html.org/#how-to-use-ai2html) for help. When
you're ready to export, run File >> Scripts >> ai2html. The resulting
graphic will appear within the base template when you load your graphic!


Adding a new graphic template
-----------------------------

To create and use a new graphic template, you will need to follow several steps:

First, choose a suitable existing template and copy its folder. For example:

```
cd graphic_templates
cp -r line_chart scatterplot
```

Second, open the COPY Google Spreadsheet for the pre-existing graphic template ("line_chart" in the example above). Make a copy of this document and adjust the headline in the copy to match the new chart type. Be sure to make this new spreadsheet public. (Share > Get Shareable Link > Can View). Copy the key for the new spreadsheet from the URL and paste it into the `graphic_config.py` for your new template.

Third, modify the new template to render your new chart type. Remove any dependencies you don't need for this graphic type. You can test your graphic template using the local server, for instance: [http://localhost:8000/templates/scatterplot/?refresh=1](http://localhost:8000/templates/scatterplot/?refresh=1)

Before you can use your new template you'll also need to add a fab command. In ``fabfile/__init__.py`` scroll down to the tasks for creating graphics and add a task for your new template, like this:

```
@task
def add_scatterplot(slug):
    """
    Create a scatterplot.
    """
    _add_graphic(slug, 'scatterplot')
```

Finally, commit your new graphic template and your fabfile changes. Your new graphic template is now ready to use.

Working With Carebot
--------------------

**This section is relevant to NPR users of the dailygraphics rig.**

[Carebot](https://thecarebot.github.io) is a grant-funded project to measure and report more meaningful analytics around stories and story elements (like graphics). This branch of dailygraphics includes test code that the Carebot team has developed to measure 1) how long a dailygraphics embedded project is visible onscreen and 2) how far users have scrolled down the length of a story. Carebot is still a work in progress, and the code we've implemented so far is likely to change.

We have created a `CAREBOT_ENABLED` configuration option on dailygraphics `app_config.py`. It allows you to switch `Carebot` on or off on your graphics. Since `carebot-tracker` is being served directly by NPR from a CDN you do not need to add any new javascript files to this repo.

**`CAREBOT_ENABLED` is set to `True` by default on `app_config.py`, change it to `False` on your fork to disable `Carebot`.**

If `CAREBOT_ENABLED` is set to `True`, new graphics created using the usual `fab add[type of graphic]:$slug` process will have the latest Carebot code. However, older graphics may need to be retrofitted as needed before being published.

#### How To Add/Update Carebot Code In An Existing Graphic

Copy the [pymChild analytics code](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics/blob/master/graphic_templates/graphic/js/graphic.js#L17-L22) from the `onWindowLoaded` function of `dailygraphics/graphic_templates/graphic/js/graphic.js` to the same spot in the `js/graphic.js` file for your project.

```
pymChild.onMessage('on-screen', function(bucket) {
    ANALYTICS.trackEvent('on-screen', bucket);
});
pymChild.onMessage('scroll-depth', function(data) {
    ANALYTICS.trackEvent('scroll-depth', data.percent, data.seconds);
});
```

These are the two custom messages that `carebot-tracker` will fire on the parent page. If `CAREBOT_ENABLED` is `False` this code on your graphic will not be executed.

Keeping the graphics directory clean
------------------------------------

If you are working with multiple users who are creating/deleting graphics, you may find that you end up with folders for deleted graphics containing only their copytext and other, uncommitted files. If this is bothering you, run:

```
git clean -dn
```

This will list folders with no committed files. To permanently delete those folders, run:

```
git clean -df
```

**NOTE:** This will delete any files that have not been committed, so
if you have any work in progress that you do not want deleted, you will
need to commit those files before running `git clean -df`.

Generating Copyedit Notes
--------------------

**This section is relevant to NPR users of the dailygraphics rig.**

The NPR Visuals team recently established a workflow for sending graphics to the NPR copyediting desk, in order to make sure that the information in each graphic is as accurate as possible. This process involves e-mailing a specific set of information to the copyedit desk (this is further expanded on in internal documentation). To help automate compiling and formatting this e-mail, run:

```
fab copyedit:$SLUG
```

This will generate an e-mail template with information specific to the graphic that the slug refers to. You can also generate a copyedit note that includes information for multiple graphics:

```
fab copyedit:$SLUG1,$SLUG2
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```
fab copyedit:$SLUG | pbcopy
```

This will automatically copy the e-mail to your clipboard, which you can then paste into an e-mail service.

#### Editing the Copyedit E-mail Templates

The basic templates for these e-mails are generated from the Jinja templates in `templates/copyedit/`. If you want to further modify these e-mail templates, you should just need to edit the files located there.
