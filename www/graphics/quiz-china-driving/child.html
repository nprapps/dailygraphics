            <h3><strong>1. When driving, the driver should be courteous and defensive, instead of being offensive.</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="correct">
                    <strong>Yes</strong>
                    <span class="answer">The test-writers mean "aggressive." Chinese drivers are incredibly aggressive, but not particularly offensive. Despite a highly competitive traffic culture, you don't see many people react angrily here even when someone cuts them off. Road rage is rare.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="incorrect">
                    <strong>No</strong>

        <div class="question">
            <h3><strong>2. The driving license of 10-year validity will be issued if the penalty points never reached 12 points in every scoring cycle during the 6-year validity of the license.</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="correct">
                    <strong>Yes</strong>
                    <span class="answer">The test has many questions about how China's point system works, the details of which I found impossible to remember, so I just guessed.</span>

                    <strong>C. They walk around at will and can easily change directions.</strong>
                    <span class="answer">Pedestrians can be quite chaotic. When I lived in Beijing in the 1990s, they often crossed the street like schooling fish. Traffic can also be a free-for-all where vehicles show no interest in yielding for pedestrians. Once, when I was in a crosswalk here in Shanghai, a three-wheeled motorized scooter drove over my foot.</span>

        <div class="question">
            <h3>On the expressway, the minimum speed is 60 km/hr, the maximum speed is 120 km/hr. If there have 2 lanes in the same direction on the expressway, the speed limit of the right lane is 60~100 km/hr, and the speed limit of the left lane is 100~120 km/hr. If there have 3 lanes in the same direction, the speed limit of the far right lane is 60~90 km/hr, that of the middle lane is 90~110 km/hr, and that of the far left lane is 110~120 km/hr. So overtaking must be from the left side.</h3>

                    <strong>D. 90km/hr</strong>
                    <span class="answer">Traffic rules are complex and require a lot of memorization. After passing the test, most drivers seem to forget or ignore them. With the installation of traffic cameras, though, cabbies are especially careful of sticking to the speed limit these days.</span>

            <h3>Three priviledged passing rights: turning around yields to going straight, coming from right side road goes first, turning right yields to turning left.</h3>

                    <strong>A. Yes</strong>
                    <span class="answer">A major challenge with this question is the translation. "Privileged passing" means "right of way." Drivers routinely make turns in front of lanes of oncoming traffic. I picked up this habit in Beijing and briefly brought it home to the U.S., where I would drive other motorists crazy for the first few days of a visit.</span>
